Introduction To Product Management
Product management is the practice of planning, developing, marketing, and
continuous improvement of a company's product or products.
The idea of product management first appeared in the early 30s with a memo
written by the president of Procter & Gamble, Neil H. McElroy, where he introduced
the idea of a product manager - a "brand man" completely responsible for a brand
and instrumental to its growth.
Decades later, in the 1980s, modern product management started to take shape with
the explosive growth of the software market. Since then, product management has
been closely connected to and typically found in companies creating software.

What Is Product Management?
The main objective of product management is the development of a new product. Its
ultimate goal is making sure you're building the right product and building the
product right.

Most notably, product management means linking the development team on the
one side with marketing, sales, and customer success teams on the other side, while
ensuring the process is aligned with the business vision.
Product management should translate business objectives into engineering
requirements and explain product functionalities and limitations to commercial
teams responsible for marketing, sales, and customer communication.

Inbound Vs. Outbound Product Management
Since product management is such a large concept, organizations usually split
responsibilities across departments. That's why we can differentiate between
inbound and outbound product management.
Inbound product management involves market research, industry trends, and
competitive analysis as well as the overall strategy and product roadmap.
Inbound product management responsibilities include:
Customer research and insights
Business care analysis
Positioning
6
Product roadmapping
Market requirements and prioritization
Whole product definition
Differentiation and desirability
Features/cost/schedule trade-offs
Developing product requirements with engineering and UX
Competitive analysis (product and market position)
Beta programs
Outbound product management focuses on product marketing - branding,
messaging, positioning, product launches, PR, advertising, etc.
Outbound product management responsibilities include:
Launch and marketing plans
Features and benefits
Messaging by market and role
Training
Sales tools
Product launch
Marketing program
Success stories
Market analysis
Competitive analysis (price, promotion, and place)

Roles in Product Management
The concept of product management includes many different roles such as chief
product officer, director of product management, product manager, product owner,
and product marketing manager, to name just a few.
It's important to keep in mind that product management and project management
are two different roles.
There can be one person or a whole team in charge of product management. The
number of people involved will largely depend on the size of the company. In some
cases (for example, in growing startups) one person takes on several different roles
- acting as a CEO, product manager, and product marketing manager.
8
Product Manager's Roles And
Responsibilities
A product team without a product manager is like an orchestra without a conductor.
Even a group of phenomenal virtuosos would be completely uncoordinated and
sound discordant without a conductor to guide and synchronize them.
Much like a conductor, a product manager is supposed to lead a cross-functional
product team and coordinate product creation from strategy to execution. A product
manager needs to be the leader who will ensure that everyone on the team is
working toward the same goal.
To be able to handle such a complex and versatile role, a great product manager
should be knowledgeable in several areas, most notably technology, business, and
user experience.
What Does a Product Manager Do?
A product manager is responsible for setting a strategic plan for product creation and
making sure that the plan is executed. In other words, a product manager is in
charge of the following:
Conducting market research, competitor analysis, and customer research
Setting a product vision and strategy that states the unique value of the
product
Creating a product roadmap with a clearly defined action plan, defining the
responsibilities and the timeline
Coordinating among design, engineering, and marketing teams
Owning the Daily Scrum and Sprint Planning meetings, ensuring that all
developers understand the user stories and are clear on what needs to be
built
9
Defining and analyzing product metrics and analytics
Put even more simply, as a product manager, you will have three main
responsibilities:
1. Set the strategy and long-term vision
2. Share this strategy with all the stakeholders
3. Oversee the execution of the strategy

A great product manager should be the go-to person for all questions related to the
product and the linking element of the whole team. That's why they need to be as
transparent as possible in the prioritizing process.
Although the product manager will have the final say, it's important to keep all
stakeholders in the loop when it comes to making decisions.
Having all the data necessary in one place - or one tool - will make it much easier for
product managers to explain why they are prioritizing certain features over others
and why they sometimes have to say no.
What Software Should a Product Manager Use?
To be productive in the role of a product manager, you should find the right tools
that will make your job easier. Nowadays, there are many product management
tools that help you develop your whole product strategy and keep all information in
one place.
Here are some product management software features that come in handy:
User tracking/analysis - One of the best ways to get insight into your users ,
behavior and the way they react to your product. This way, you can
continually improve the product to better fit user needs.
Customer survey tools - Direct customer feedback is invaluable, as you can
learn all about the things your users love or hate about a product. Some
product management software lets you create survey templates and easily
send survey forms to your users.
Prototyping - Get your product on the right track from the first step. Create a
prototype you can easily share with the stakeholders.
Roadmapping - A roadmapping tool helps you define features and plan
releases, track development status and progress, plan and allocate
development resources, and collaborate with your product team.
11
Task management - Assign tasks to team members and follow task progress
in real time, define and prioritize tasks, and streamline your whole task
management process.
Data management/sharing - A quality product management tool makes
it
simple to upload and share documents and data with your team members.
Instant messaging - Be able to quickly contact anyone on the team and get
the information you need as soon as possible.
To learn more about the right tools to use, you can read our review of the 20 best
product management software for everything from small businesses to enterprises.
Product Strategy
Before you start building a product, you'll need to have a solid plan - or a product
strategy.
Product strategy is the foundation of the entire product lifecycle. It should answer 3
main questions:
1. What are you building?
2. Why are you building it?
3. How are you building it?
12
Product Strategy
Product Vision
Why are you building this exact product?
Customer Persona
Who is your ideal customer?
Product Positioning
How does your product fit in the market?
Product Differentiation
How is your product better from your competiton?
F
Goals & Initiatives
What do you want to achieve and how?
Aside from being a plan for building the product, product strategy should provide
direction to the product manager and the whole team and set out the steps
necessary to turn the product into success.
As such, it involves all aspects of product creation:
Development
Marketing
Sales
Support
13
A great product strategy should define the following:
Product Vision
Product vision should determine the 'why 'behind your product. Why are you
building this exact product and why should people care about it? It should capture
the essence of what you want to accomplish with your product, and how it will
improve the lives of the people using it.
Target Market/Customer Persona
Next, it's time to answer the question 'who'. Who is going to be using your product?
For this, you'll need to determine the target market - the segment of people who
will be most likely to use your product, and you'll need to define your customer
persona - your ideal customer, together with their goals, challenges, buying
motivation, and objectives.
This will be crucial to decide how your product will look, how you will communicate
with your audience, where you will reach them, etc.
Product Positioning
Product positioning means defining how your product fits into the marketplace.
Rather than changing the product itself, product positioning focuses on the
messaging, the way you're going to present your product to the world, and how your
audience will perceive it.
However, the most important thing about positioning is to be realistic - positioning is
not about how you describe your product, it's ultimately how your users perceive it.
Product Differentiation
Product differentiation should answer the following questions:
How does your product differ from other similar products on the market?
What are its unique values that would motivate your customers to choose your
product over another one?
14
To be able to do proper product differentiation, you'll need to perform a thorough
competitive analysis. This way, you can get to know your competition and discover
how to outshine them.
Goals and Initiatives
Lastly, product strategy includes product goals and initiatives. The goals should be
clearly defined, measurable, and time-bound to help you and your team understand
what you want to achieve with the product. We'll talk more about ways to set
SMART goals later in the guide.
After setting your goals, it's time to define initiatives, which are high-level efforts
necessary to achieve the goals you've set.
Product strategy will be your guide throughout the whole product creation process
and essential for both inbound and outbound product management. That's why
strategy is important for the whole team and should be visible to the stakeholders.
In this chapter, we'll define best practices for setting out product strategy and
explain how to create a detailed, transparent strategy that will help the whole team
know where the product is headed and how you're planning to get there.
How To Define a Product Vision To
Guide Your Team
Your product vision should capture the essence of what you want your product to
accomplish. In one or two sentences, you should be able to explain where your
product is headed and what its ultimate long-term goal is.
In other words, you'll need to determine the "why" behind your product, the reason
for its existence on the market. You need to ask yourself "why am I creating this
exact product?"

Once you define your product vision, it will be like a compass for your whole team,

Creating a Product Vision Statement
When creating a product vision statement, you need to have your end user in mind.
So instead of focusing on what the product should accomplish for you and your
company, you need to shift focus to the end user.
What do you want your product to achieve for your users? As cheesy as it sounds -
how are you planning to make the world a better place with your product?
16
Having this in mind, the product vision needs to also capture the essence of your
audience - their challenges, problems, and goals - and the way your product is
ultimately going to make their lives better.
Creating a product vision board will help you arrive at your vision statement.

When it comes to the product management process, a product vision is a guiding
light that will help you set up your whole product strategy.
The product vision should help you:
Create a better product roadmap
Give your team directions along the way
Align your whole team while working toward the same goal.
Even though all stakeholders should participate in developing the product vision
statement, the product manager should have the final say and polish the final
version.
17
Product Vision Examples
Here are some examples of the product vision statements from the world's most
successful companies:
Microsoft: A computer on every desk and in every home.
Google: To provide access to the world's information with one click.
Amazon: To be Earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find
and discover anything they might want to buy online.
Samsung: Inspire the world. Create the future.
Instagram: To capture and share the world's moments.
Infinity: To help companies realize their vision.
How To Set Your Product Vision in Infinity
Everyone on your team should live by your vision. That's why it's important to keep it
visible for the whole team. Here's how to add the product vision to your Infinity
framework:
Step 1: Load the Product Management template into your workspace.
Step 2: Open the Vision subfolder located in the Product Strategy folder.
Step 3: Open every item and briefly answer the question in the Description
field.
Step 4: Use the last column to write your vision statement based on previous
questions. Use the examples from the Description field as inspiration but then
delete them and write your own vision statement.

How To Define Your Target Market and
Customer Persona
Once you've created the product vision, you'll need to determine who you're
creating this product for.
For this, you'll have to define your target market and then go a step further to define
your customer persona(s). So what is the difference between the two?
19
Defining Your Target Market
Defining your target market will give you the segment of people you're targeting,
according to their age, location, education, industry, interests, gender, and similar
demographic information. Of course, you don't have to note down all these details,
only those that are relevant to your product.
Although narrowing down your audience may sound counterintuitive at first, it's a
crucial step. The fact of the matter is that you can't sell to everyone, and if your
marketing scope is too wide, you'll only be wasting your resources.
Marketing to everyone is like shooting darts in the dark - you will probably run out
of darts before you even hit the dartboard once.
Keep in mind that the target market and the target audience are two separate
things. The target market are people who will be using your product, and the target
audience are people you're selling the product to.
Here's an example: you're making software that helps children learn to read. Your
target market are children aged 5-8. But, since kids of that age rarely have money (or
the desire) to invest in software, your target audience are their parents,
grandparents, etc.
So, when making the product, you keep your target market in mind, but when selling
the product, you sell it to the target audience. In most cases, these two are the same
group of people or they greatly overlap, but sometimes they are completely
different.
Creating Your Customer Persona
A customer persona (also known as a buyer persona) is the representation of your
ideal customer based on market analysis and data collected from existing customers.
Aside from demographics, a customer persona should give you information about
your ideal customers such as their typical buying behavior, their lifestyle, needs,
problems and challenges, goals, and motivations.

Once you define your customer persona (or personas), it will help you further
develop your strategy when it comes to the product itself but also marketing and
sales. You'll be able to know where to find your ideal customers, how to speak their
language, create the features they need, deliver the content they're interested in,
and even predict their common objections.
How To Create Customer Personas in Infinity
All stakeholders should be able to have a say in approving customer personas you
have created, as this step will influence many future decisions. The easiest way to
share customer personas with everyone is to create a product management board in
Infinity. By using the Columns view, you can create a new column for each persona
so that you have an overview of all personas at a glance. As you create a new
persona, you can add all relevant information about them along with images that will
help you visualize the personas you have created.
Here's an example of Business Owner, Product Manager, and Project Manager

You can easily create your customer persona(s) using the Infinity Product
Management template.
Step 1: Open the Customer Personas subfolder located in the Product Strategy
folder.
Step 2: Click the item you want to change and a modal will appear.
Step 3: Write a brief description of your persona in the Description field.
Step 4: Add a list of the persona's goals. What does your ideal customer want
to accomplish that your product can help them with? When it comes to a B2B
company, the ultimate goal will always be to grow their business and increase
revenue, but you should also add some goals specific to your product. If you
have a B2C business, the situation is a bit different. For example, if your
product is a workout app, your persona's goal can be to lose weight or stay fit.
Step 5: Add the persona's challenges. What problems and challenges is your
ideal customer facing daily that your product could solve? For Infinity, a typical
challenge is "the team needs to use several tools, which causes confusion,
22
delays, and misunderstanding". Knowing your persona's biggest challenges
will help you build the best solution to these exact problems.
Step 6: Add the persona's buying motivation. What motivates this person to
buy your specific product? Out of all other similar products on the market,
what would be their biggest motivation to buy yours? For example: "they feel
limited by the tools they are currently using". Defining buying motivation will
help you determine what sets your product apart from others on the market
and identify its greatest value.
Step 7: Add the persona's buying concerns. What would be the main objection
that could prevent this person from buying your product? Maybe the tool
they're currently using is free and yours isn't, or they think that it would take
too much effort to switch to your product if they're already using something
similar. By defining these objections you'll be able to prepare
counterarguments and solutions that would remove the persona's buying
concerns.
Step 8: Add products similar to yours that your persona may already be using.
This way, you will get a better idea of how your product should outshine and
replace them in the eye of your ideal customer.
Step 9: Add the persona's industry to the Industry field.
Step 10: Add their job to the Job field.
Step 11: Remove the current image from the template and add one that
represents your customer persona.
Step 12: Repeat the process to add more customer personas.
Once you've defined your customer personas, this will be a strong foundation that
will determine all your decisions. But, you should be ready to learn about your
audience as you go and even adapt your target market and customer personas if you
see the need for it in the future.
Unsure how to start? Preview or download the Product Management template and
check out the examples of 3 customer personas we have created along with their
goals, challenges, buying motivation, buying concerns, and tools they use. You can
use these to build your customer personas off of.
23
Product Positioning - How Your Product
Fits in the Market
The next step in your product strategy is product positioning.
Product positioning means defining where your product fits in the marketplace. So
rather than changing the product itself, positioning represents the messaging - how
you want your audience to perceive your product.
To be able to position your product, you will need to determine your target market
first, which we explained in the previous chapter. Only after you have defined your
target market, you'll be able to figure out what kind of message you want to send to
them, and the best channels for sending it.
Once you know the group of people you're creating the product for and once you
have your customer persona(s), you'll be able to translate their core values and
needs into the product benefits that will sound most appealing to them. And you'll
be able to create a message that resonates with them.
However, there is one important detail you need to keep in mind. No matter how
you position your product, you need to make sure to deliver on the promise. Because
at the end of the day, positioning is not what you say about your product, it's how
your audience perceives it.
If you have several audience segments, you will also need to adjust your messaging,
since different audience segments may see different benefits from your product.
Aside from that, you'll need to adjust your messaging depending on the channel
you're using. For example, your style will have to be completely different when
sending an email, writing a Facebook post, or creating a banner.
24
Creating Your Product Positioning Statement
Ultimately, your positioning statement should define your target audience, the
unique features that set your product apart from the competition, and the benefits
that the users will have from it. According to the famous organizational theorist and
management consultant, Geoffrey Moore, a product positioning statement formula
should look something like this:
For (target customer) who (has a specific problem or a need), our product is a
(product category) that (provides this key benefit/solves this problem/fulfills this
need). Unlike (primary competitive alternative), our product (provides this unique
value).
For Infinity, this statement could translate to:
For a product manager who has a framework but doesn 't have a tool to support it,
Infinity is a flexible solution that allows them to build their own system and organize
every aspect of the product lifecycle. Unlike other tools on the market that provide a
fixed system, Infinity gives the user the ability to create their own product
management system.
Don't forget that product positioning is all about crafting a compelling message that
resonates with your target audience. Once you do that, it will serve as the
foundation for your product management strategy.
Product Positioning Matrix
To help you visualize your product compared to your competitors, it is a great idea to
create a product positioning matrix. By using this method, you will be able to realize
which product aspects are the most valuable in your product and how this makes
your product stand out from the rest.
The product positioning matrix should have two axes, both representing an
important value in your market. Quality and price are the most common ones, but
you can use any other values that are relevant to your product. In the example of
Infinity, the product positioning matrix looks like this:

How To Define Product Positioning in Infinity
Just like all other parts of your product strategy, product positioning should also be
visible for you and your team at all times. That's why it's important to include it in
your product management framework.
If you use the Product Management template, it's pretty simple to add product
positioning to your strategy by following the steps below.

Add
Here's how to add your product positioning in Infinity:
Step 1: Open the Product Positioning subfolder located in the Product Strategy
folder.
Step 2: Replace the product positioning statement from the first column with
your own.
Step 3: Before you create a visual product positioning matrix (like the one we
mentioned before), you'll need to define the main categories and main
competitors you want to include. So in this step, choose 5-10 main
competitors and pick the two axes. In our example, the values are Structure
(Expansive - Simple) and System (Flexible - Fixed).
Step 4: Replace the sample product positioning matrix with your own. Click
this item and find the Image attribute to replace the sample image with a new
one.
Even if you don't use Infinity, you can preview this template directly from the
browser to get samples of product positioning and the product positioning matrix.

Product Differentiation - What's Your
Competitive Edge
Although often defined as a marketing process, product differentiation is much more
than that. It is related to every aspect of the product and every part of your team,
which is why it belongs right here, in the chapter about product strategy.
Unless you have an incredibly unique idea for a product that nobody has thought of
before, chances are you're going to enter a competitive market with lots of similar
products already available. Product differentiation should answer the following
question - what does your product offer that other similar products on the market
don't? What is the unique value of your product that makes it stand out from the
competition?
This kind of differentiation can be focused on any aspect of your product. Maybe
you're planning to offer a better, more beautiful design. Maybe you're going to
develop unique features that your competitors don't have. Or, you're simply
planning to offer a lower price and better customer support.
All these aspects are an opportunity for product differentiation, and ultimately
product differentiation should motivate the customer to choose your product over
another one.
Ideally, product differentiation should explain to your target audience how your
product offers everything similar products have and more.
Competitive Analysis
To be able to differentiate your product from the competition, you first need to
know who your competitors are and what they have to offer. This is called
competitive analysis.
28
First of all, you'll need to create a list of your ten biggest competitors. After you
compile that list, it's time for a thorough analysis. You'll need to define all relevant
factors in your niche such as:
Feature segments
Design
Company size
Prices
Website traffic
Number of users
Customer support
Other
One of the most important things to analyze when it comes to SaaS products are the
feature segments. Feature segments are groups of features that are commonly
found in your niche. Defining them will help you create initiatives and build your
product roadmap.
To define the feature segments in your niche, you'll need to do the following steps:
1. Find and note down all your major competitors
2. List all the features these tools have
3. Group those features into segments
Setting a Competition Grid in Infinity
Once you have your feature segments and a list of competitors, it's time to create a
competition grid where you will visually present your analysis. You can do that by
using a table in Infinity.
Here's a product differentiation example from Infinity.
1. We created feature segments such as Structure, Views, Attributes, Customization,
Usability, Design, Pricing, etc. Each segment is a separate item.
29
2. We created a column for each competitor (including Infinity) in the shape of the
'Rating 'attribute.
3. In each segment, we rated tools on how accomplished they are in this category -
one star denoting poor performance and five stars denoting excellent performance.
For example, Infinity gets five stars for 'Structure 'because of its flexible structure
and powerful folders and subfolders, but gets a 3-star rating for 'Collaboration
,
because it doesn't have advanced collaboration features like live chat.
Check out the Infinity competition grid below:

To create your own competition grid in Infinity, you can use the Product
Management template. Here's how:
Step 1: Open the Product Differentiation subfolder located in the Product
Strategy folder.
Step 2: Delete all items in the first column to get a clean table you can fill out
with your data. You can do it by clicking the three dots symbol next to the
item.

factors.
Step 4: Edit the column names. Your tool should be in the first column,
followed by your competitors. Just click the name of the column to edit it.
Step 5: Rate your tool against your competitors by filling in the stars in the
columns.
Once you set up the competition grid, you will be able to see your competitors 'weak
points. This will also help you discover how your product fits into the market and
how it can stand out - by its design, features, price, or something else.
By using feature segments, you'll be able to identify your product's potential weak
points, which will help you understand how you can improve the product to
outperform competition and give your users something unique and valuable.

How To Set Smart, Measurable
Product Goals
Product goals are the highest-level objectives regarding the product - the big, bold
ideas for your product and business in the future. These goals should be the crucial
achievements that need to happen to turn your vision into reality.
By always keeping product goals in front of you and your team, you will make it
much easier to focus on what needs to be done and when.
Although product goals are abstract, they should derive from KPIs. In other words,
they should be measurable and achievable within a certain timeframe.
How To Set SMART Goals
Setting goals might turn out more challenging than you expect. The SMART
methodology provides one of the best guidelines for coming up with the right goals
and for defining them the right way.
Here's what the acronym SMART stands for:
S = specific, significant, stretching
M = measurable, meaningful, motivational
A = agreed upon, attainable, achievable, acceptable, action-oriented
R = realistic, relevant, reasonable, rewarding, results-oriented
T = time-based, time-bound, timely, tangible, trackable
Aside from creating SMART goals, you'll need to ensure they are aligned with your
overall product strategy and business strategy.
32
Here are a few examples of high-level product goals that will help you drive your
product forward:
Become #1 work and data management platform by 2025
Become a $1 billion company by January 2024
Develop an exceptionally secure and trustworthy application by 2023
Reach 1 million users by Q1 2025
Setting Product Goals in Infinity
The goals you set will determine the direction of your product and drive the smaller,
short-term goals and actions necessary for the strategy execution. You can set the
goals in a separate folder where stakeholders can keep an eye on them, and give
editing access only to the product owner and product manager.
Setting product goals using Infinity is pretty easy with the help of our Product
Management template. All you need to do is follow these steps:
Step 1: Open the Goals subfolder in the Product Strategy folder.
Step 2: Delete all sample goals, or leave one goal to use as a template and
delete everything else.
Step 3: Add a new item by clicking the plus sign below the first column.
Step 4: Write your first goal in the Name section.
Step 5: Add a goal description to the Description field.
Step 6: In Requirements, add a checklist of all requirements that need to be
met to achieve this goal.
Step 7: Add an end date to set the timeframe for the goal.
Step 8: Repeat the process for all your goals.
Step 9: As you make progress with your goals, you can move them from one
column to another - from Planning to Working on It, to Ongoing, and finally
Achieved.

How To Set Actionable Product Initiatives
Once you set your product goals, initiatives will be the actual steps you'll need to
take if you want to reach those goals. Even so, product initiatives don't have to be
tied to a specific goal as long as they're aligned with your overall product strategy
and vision.
The timeframe necessary to complete an initiative can vary from a few months to
even a few years. For example, one initiative can be to improve the conversion rate
by 3% which can take a few months to accomplish. If your initiative is to reach
100,000 signups, this will take much longer to complete.
The important thing is to set a timeframe and stick to it so you can track your
progress, measure the results, and improve your strategy over time.
34
Here are some examples of product initiatives:
Get 10,000 new users by November 2024
Increase free trial engagement by 5%
Get into the top 10 tools for project management
Build 3 collaboration features
Improve onboarding by 50%
It's easy to see why initiatives are such an important part of your product strategy,
but they have more than a single purpose.
Firstly, they will help you figure out what needs to be done inside and outside the
product in order to reach the desired goals. Once you lay the initiatives out in the
roadmap, you'll be able to share and track them with the team so everyone can be in
the loop.
And finally, you'll be able to analyze the effort and impact of your initiatives, so you
can tweak your product strategy accordingly and allocate resources in an optimal
way.
Setting Initiatives in Infinity
In Infinity, you can set aside a folder for product initiatives. Just like goals, these
initiatives shouldn't be too complicated. You should keep all information to a
minimum that helps your team understand the initiative, its requirements, and
timeframe.

Product Roadmap
If the product were a building, the product roadmap would be its blueprint. In other
words, you can't even begin to build a successful product without a solid product
roadmap.
So, what is a product management roadmap and why is it so important?
A product roadmap is an important document for both your internal teams and
external stakeholders. The purpose of a roadmap is to provide several valuable
aspects, including:
Providing the framework for your product development process
Keeping all stakeholders on the same page (including your team, investors,
and even customers)
37
Helping to predict how much development power will be necessary to deliver
the features you're planning
After defining your product strategy, creating a product roadmap is the next priority.
A roadmap is a guiding document that outlines the direction of your product and the
plan for executing the strategy. In other words, a product roadmap is a map of
features and functionalities that you're planning to add to your product and the
general time frame necessary to develop them.

What Is an Agile Product Roadmap?
When it comes to building SaaS products, there are numerous methodologies to
choose from. However, one of the most popular methodologies for developing
software is Agile. The main idea behind the Agile methodology is focusing the whole
development process on satisfying the end user and embracing the changing
requirements that are an inevitable part of this process.
This means that when creating a product roadmap, you need to make sure it is
completely flexible and regularly updated. The market and your audience will dictate
the priorities, and your product management roadmap needs to reflect that.
Setting a Product Roadmap in Infinity
If you're looking to outline your strategy, keep your whole product team in the loop,
and ultimately build the best possible product, you can easily do it by using Infinity's
Product Roadmap template.

How To Get Ideas for Features
Once you've set up your product strategy with goals and initiatives, coming up with
ideas for your product is not going to be a problem. But you will need to make sure
that all the ideas that make the cut and find their way to your backlog are aligned
with your product strategy.
For example, if one of your initiatives is to increase conversions by 15%, you need to
make sure that your feature ideas are going to contribute toward achieving that goal.
You should also remember to align your feature ideas with the feature segments
you've determined in one of the previous steps. For example, you can divide feature
ideas into segments like Structure, Views, Usability, Accessibility, Design, etc.
When it comes to getting ideas for features, you can find inspiration in multiple
places. It's very important to write ideas down as soon as they are conceived, to
make sure you don't forget them. If you're using a product management tool like
Infinity, you can add items labeled as Ideas to your product roadmap.
40
Your Ideas
As the product manager, you will know the product like the back of your hand. This
means that you will always know best which features are missing, what needs
improvement, or what the users will find the most valuable.
You can come up with ideas in the following ways:
Analytics will help you see what customers need and which areas of the
product need improvement.
Using the product every day will give you great insight into the problematic
areas and bugs as well as potential new features.
Market research will help you figure out the way market trends are changing
and how to improve the product to keep up with those trends.
Solo brainstorming - dedicate time to think about new ideas and you'll be
surprised with the outcome.
Team Ideas
At the beginning of this guide, we mentioned that the product management process
requires involvement from the whole team. That's why your whole team should be
somewhat involved in the process of creating the product roadmap.
Each part of the team - engineering, marketing, sales, customer success - will have
their unique insights about the product because they see it from a different angle.
Developers will know best how each new feature will fit inside the code. Marketing
and sales teams can predict what would bring the biggest impact on your bottom
line. The customer success team talks to the users every day and knows their
problems best.
That's why you should make it possible for your team members to note down their
suggestions in the product roadmap. That way, anyone can directly contribute by
adding an idea. One of the best ways to get the most out of your team members is to
regularly organize brainstorming sessions.
41
User Ideas
At the end of the day, you're creating the product for the end user. That's why some
of your best ideas will come directly from your users.
Make sure to stay in touch with your users/customers through support channels, live
demo calls, and community channels (such as a forum or a Facebook group). Your
users will be eager to give suggestions, report bugs, and offer plenty of honest
feedback that will help you build the product.
A good approach is to directly ask users for their opinions by having polls on what
features they want to see next or by providing a form for user suggestions.
Competitors
Picasso once said (and Steve Jobs confirmed): "good artists copy; great artists steal."
There's nothing wrong with keeping tabs on your competitors and copying (or
stealing) ideas from them.
In fact, that is the only smart thing to do. So make sure to check on your main
competitors products from time to time, follow their new releases, read their blog,
and pick up a few ideas along the way.
Setting Ideas in Infinity
As we already mentioned, it's very useful to include ideas in the product roadmap,
but it's also important to keep them separate from the features that are already
defined and ready for design and development.
The best way to do this is to create a 'Stage 'label set that will include 'Idea 'as the
first label. Grouped by Stage, your product roadmap will then clearly show all your
ideas neatly listed in the first column. You'll also be able to create a separate tab and
filter out ideas only so you can have them all in one place.
Here's how to add new ideas to your Infinity roadmap:
Step 1: Open the Roadmap folder from the Product Roadmap template.
42
Step 2: Delete the example Ideas from the first column.
Step 3: Add a new item by clicking the plus sign below the Idea column.
Step 4: In the Name section, write down your feature idea.
Step 5: Add a short description of the idea to the Description field.
Step 6: You can add a Priority label if necessary.
Step 7: You can add a Feature Segment reference if you want. You'll find this
field if you scroll down to the bottom of the item.
Step 8: You can leave the rest of the fields empty until you decide whether to
implement this idea or not. After you move the idea to the next column, you
will fill in the rest of the information.
Step 9: If you want to see only your ideas, click the third tab named Ideas.

How To Prioritize the Right Features
Once you have your feature ideas, it's time to choose which ones are going to the
product roadmap. To be able to do this you will need to prioritize the ideas.
Prioritizing With the ICE Score
When you're developing a product, there are a great number of ways to prioritize
features on the roadmap. Whatever method you choose, it's important to cut
subjectivity out of the equation.
All the people who contributed with their feature ideas (you, your team, and the
users) will feel very strongly about their own ideas. The prioritization process
shouldn't be in favor of the loudest or most persuasive person.
The process should be as objective as possible so that you end up prioritizing the
features that are the right choice for the product and the majority of users. This way,
you can deliver the features that will add the most value first.
As we said, you can try one of the many methods to prioritize the features. When it
comes to Infinity and our roadmap, we use the ICE scoring system.
The ICE framework is the feature evaluation method that relies on three factors -
impact, confidence, and ease.
Impact: How impactful will this feature be (regarding user experience as well
as product goals)?
Confidence: How certain is it that this will prove my hypothesis (based on
existing data)?
Ease: How much effort by time is necessary to deliver this feature?
Each of these three criteria should get a 1-10 grade, and the average is considered
the ICE score.
44
For example, if we have a feature called 'Onboarding Tour 'we can grade it this way:
Impact: 8
Confidence: 6
Ease: 7
ICE Score: (8+6+7)/3=7
It's important to note that all stakeholders should be taken into account for the
scoring process - including all decision-making team members as well as
users/customers. Even so, the ICE method is not perfect, as it can result in a lot of
biased information.
However, ICE shouldn't be taken too rigidly. This method is not supposed to be
perfect - it's supposed to help product owners evaluate ideas more easily and make
data-driven decisions, instead of getting overwhelmed by everyone's subjective
opinions.
How To Define Features in Infinity
Once you've prioritized your ideas, those with the highest scores should be moved to
the next column - To Define - where you will add other important details
necessary for creating this feature.
So here's how you will turn an idea into a feature:
Step 1: Open the Roadmap folder.
Step 2: Delete the sample items in the roadmap, or leave a few to use as a
template.
Step 3: Move the idea to the To Define column by using drag and drop.
Step 4: Click the idea to open it.
45
Step 5: Provide a short description of the feature in the Description field. You
can keep using the one you wrote already. A part of the description should
include the ICE score.
Step 6: Add user stories in the form of a checklist. If you're following the Agile
methodology, the best way to describe features is through user stories. One
product feature can consist of one or several user stories so you can use a
checklist to turn user stories into tasks or update the list with new ones.
Step 7: Add an assignee who will be responsible for delivering this feature.
Step 8: Add a priority label - High, Medium, or Low.
Step 9: Add start and end dates to set the feature time frame. Make sure you
keep the dates flexible at the roadmap level.
Step 10: Add a Feature Segment reference to link the feature with the
segment from the Product Differentiation subfolder.
Step 11: Add an Initiative reference to link the feature to the corresponding
initiative(s).
Step 12: Move the feature to the next column. Keep moving the feature to the
next column each time it progresses to the next stage.

What Are User Stories and
How To Write Them
User stories are small units of development that describe a product functionality
from the user's perspective. Instead of giving a technical description of a
functionality, a user story gives a clear idea of what a user wants to accomplish with
it.
A lot of development teams rely on technical descriptions as well, which means you
don't have to eliminate them altogether. Still, it's important to keep the focus on
user stories and the user's point of view.
Why You Need User Stories
User stories are incredibly useful because they provide a user-centric work
framework and allow the engineering team to be as creative as they like, as long as
they deliver the end result expected by the user.
Since user stories are supposed to represent the user's point of view, they should be
short and simple descriptions written in non-technical language. After reading a
story, the team should know what they are building, why they are building it, and
what kind of value it will provide to the end user.
How To Write User Stories
The stories are written by the product manager or product owner, but they should
be as simple as possible, narrowed down to one or two sentences. If the story is too
complicated to write, it might mean that it should be broken down into several
smaller user stories.
The details of a user story are added after a discussion with the team. This is where
the product manager and the development team come together. At this point,
47
features are broken down into several smaller user stories that can be delivered in a
shorter time frame.
This discussion should also provide the conditions of satisfaction - or acceptance
criteria - which are a list of conditions that need to be met for the story to be
considered complete.
User Story Template
How to write user stories? Typically, a user story template looks like this:
As a [type of user], I want to [accomplish some goal] so that [reason].
For example, this is how one user story in your product roadmap could look:
As a user, / want to be able to sort my tasks in a way that makes the most sense to
me.
User Story Examples
However, this user story can be broken down into multiple smaller stories. So here
are a few user stories examples that can come out of it:
As a user, I want to be able to sort my tasks by the due date.
As a user, I want to be able to sort my tasks by the assignee.
As a user, I want to be able to sort my tasks by priority.
Adding User Stories to Your Infinity Roadmap
Once the user stories are defined, they should be available for the whole team to
see. That's why it's essential to write your stories down as part of feature
descriptions. If you've already built a roadmap in Infinity according to the previous
steps we talked about, here's a step-by-step guide to adding user stories to the
roadmap.
48
Step 1: Open the Roadmap folder.
Step 2: Open the item you want to add user stories to by clicking on it.
Step 3: In the User Stories section, add one or more user stories related to this
feature.
Step 4: Once a user story is developed, you can check its box in the checklist.
Step 5: Add new stories if they come up.

Product Backlog
A product backlog is a prioritized list of product requirements. Simply put, a product
backlog is a list of everything that needs to be done to create the product -
features, defect fixes, and other technical work.
A typical product backlog in Scrum contains four different types of requirements
(although you can add more):
1. User stories
2. Bugs
3. Refactoring
4. Knowledge acquisition
When you create the product backlog for the very first time, you'll want to fill it out
with the best-known requirements that are aligned with your overall product
strategy - your vision, goals, and initiatives.
As your product grows, so should the backlog. One of the basic principles of agile
development is continuous work on the product, which is why the product backlog is
never complete.
If things go according to plan, your product will evolve and your community will
grow, which means that you will receive a lot of suggestions from users and the team
in order to make your product bigger and better.

Product Backlog Management
During the sprint planning meeting, you and your team will need to turn the product
backlog into the actual to-do list - or the sprint. The product manager and the
Scrum master (or the head of development) should come together to figure out
which items from the backlog should go into the next sprint. They have to make sure
to choose the optimal number of items and the most important items that can be
delivered within the coming sprint - which is all part of product backlog
management.
51
A great backlog should state clearly which ideas from your roadmap should be done
next and it should ensure that the most impactful features are delivered in each new
release.
Your product backlog should also be a reliable source of information for the whole
team. Reserve one folder for the product backlog and make sure to keep all relevant
information there.
This is how a product backlog looks in Infinity:

Types of Product Backlog Tasks
In the previous chapter, we talked about user stories, but there are four main types
of items that will be populating your product backlog. So what does a task in the
backlog represent?
Backlog tasks are classified into user stories, bugs, refactoring, and knowledge
acquisition. Let's dive into each of the four categories and learn how to define and
prioritize them.
User Stories
The majority of your backlog tasks will be in the form of user stories, which are the
most important items in your backlog. As we already said, user stories are units of
development that describe product functionalities from the users 'perspective.
For example: As an admin user, / want to be able to control who can delete a
task in my boards.
Aside from this definition, a user story needs to include the acceptance criteria,
which represents the conditions that need to be met for the story to be considered
complete.
Bugs
Bugs are errors in the code discovered during peer review or testing. A bug will end
up in your backlog most likely after it gets reported by a user or noticed by someone
on your team.
Bugs will usually be high-priority items in your product backlog. However, they
should be discussed just like other backlog items during the backlog refinement and
weekly Scrum meetings.
Example: New item on the task list appears in the middle of the list.
53
Refactoring
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing the
external behavior of the software. This results in better code readability and lower
complexity, which makes the code much easier to work with and build upon.
In other words, refactoring is essential for creating a good basis for improving the
tool and adding more value in the future.
Knowledge Acquisition
As their name suggests, knowledge acquisition tasks are tasks focusing on gathering
new information and knowledge to accomplish some future task.
Let's imagine that there is a user story that your development team doesn't know
how to tackle or that requires some prior learning. A knowledge acquisition task will
be assigned to a team member to give them the knowledge necessary to eventually
develop that user story and all similar stories in the future.
Example: Research WordPress plugin libraries and select which one to
implement.
How To Manage a Product Backlog in Infinity
Adding new tasks to the product backlog is simple when you have the Product
Management template to help you out. Here's what you need to do:
Step 1: Open the Backlog folder in the Product Management template.
Step 2: Delete all sample tasks or keep a few to serve as a template.
Step 3: Create a new task by clicking +Add new item below each group. Make
sure you add the task to the correct group depending on its type - Story, Bug,
Refactor, or Knowledge.
Step 4: Write the task in the Name field.
Step 5: In the Description field, you can briefly explain the task or add the user
story related to it.
54
Step 6: Assign a team member who will be responsible for this task.
Step 7: Add a priority level - make sure to read the next chapter where we'll
explain backlog prioritization.
Step 8: Add 'To Do" Status to high-priority tasks you're planning to work on in
the next sprint.
Step 9: After prioritization and backlog grooming, you will move high-priority
tasks directly to the sprint by using Exdrag and drop.

Task Prioritization With the
MoSCoW Method
During the product development process, you will have ideas, suggestions, and bugs
coming left, right, and center. That's why you'll need to prioritize tasks in your
backlog and make sure that the most impactful ideas are developed first.
By performing task prioritization, you will be able to divide all tasks into three
groups:
Tasks that will go into the next sprint
Tasks that will be developed later
Tasks you won't be working on at all
So, how do you prioritize the backlog?
The MoSCoW Method
There are several backlog prioritization methods that can help you manage your
backlog, and you can choose whichever works best for you. In this guide, we will
cover one of the most popular methods, called the MoSCoW method.
The MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique that allows you to reach common
ground with all stakeholders and make sure to deliver the most important
requirements first. The system differentiates between these four levels of priority:
56
Mo (Must Have): The most vital product requirements that you (or your users) can't
live without.
S (Should Have): These requirements are important but not essential for your next
release.
Co (Could Have): These requirements are nice to have, but not as important as
Should Have items.
W (Won't Have): User stories that provide little or no value so you can leave them
for later.
Once you start prioritizing tasks in your backlog in such a way, it will become much
clearer for you and the stakeholders what should be worked on in the next sprint. To
make this prioritization more visual, you can create separate labels for these four
priority levels.

57
To make your product backlog even cleaner, you can create a separate folder for
your W (Won't Have) items. You can name the folder Long Term, Future Tasks, etc. In
Infinity's Product Development board, we call this folder On Hold and we keep all
lower priority tasks there.
You should revisit this folder from time to time and check if some of these items
have deserved their spot in the backlog or if they should be completely scratched off
the list.
You don't have to follow the MoSCoW method to a tee. To make things simpler, you
can create a label set in your Backlog folder called Priority and give it values Mo -
High, S - Medium, Co - Low, and W - None. In this case, the items with no priority will
go to the 'On Hold 'folder, while the rest will become contenders for the sprint.
How To Use MoSCoW Method in Infinity
Here's how you can prioritize your backlog in Infinity's Product Management
template:
Step 1: Open the Backlog folder.
Step 2: Open an item.
Step 3: Assign a MoSCoW label.
Step 4: Repeat for each item that lands in your backlog.
To make sure you're objectively prioritizing tasks, you'll need to take into
consideration a few other factors such as:
High value to the user
High benefit to the business
Ease of implementation
Time to implement
High/low risk
Cost
Dependencies between items
58
All of these factors will be crucial to help you decide which backlog items will go into
the next sprint. Here's why this is important - sometimes you will have a medium or
low priority task that is low-risk, low-cost, and super-easy to implement. In this case,
you might consider adding this item to the sprint since it's going to be an easy but
nice-to-have addition to your next release.
The best way to adopt the MoSCoW method is through practice, which is why we
added task examples to the Product Management template. You can preview or
download the template and observe tasks in the Current Sprint, Backlog, and On
Hold folders to get an idea of how to prioritize your tasks.
Backlog Refinement, aka
Backlog Grooming
Backlog refinement, also known as backlog grooming, is the process of keeping the
backlog clean and orderly and adding the necessary details and estimates to the
product backlog items. Product refinement is the result of the product refinement
meeting held between the product owner/manager, Scrum Master, or CTO and the
development team.
During the product backlog refinement meeting, top items from the backlog are
discussed, reviewed, and revised. You should hold this meeting once per sprint and it
should happen near the end of the sprint to ensure that the backlog is ready for the
next sprint.
Why You Need To Have a Well-Groomed Backlog
Backlog refinement can have multiple important benefits. Refinement reduces
confusion and uncertainty and prepares the team to be much more efficient in the
following sprint. If done right, this meeting also helps reduce the time necessary for
the sprint planning meeting.
59
Plus, refined backlog items are much easier to estimate and implement.
In order to reach these benefits, it's crucial to include the whole development team
in the meeting (or at least as many team members as possible).
The discussion needs to be focused on gaining more insight into each backlog item
and helping the responsible team member understand what needs to be done. You
should document all decisions for future reference.
For a successful product backlog grooming meeting, each team member needs to
know their responsibilities.
The product owner or manager is supposed to lead the meeting and make
sure all decisions are in line with the overall product strategy.
Scrum Master needs to facilitate communication between the development
team and the product owner.
Developers need to find and document creative solutions for backlog items,
give time estimations, break up backlog items into smaller tasks if necessary,
and collaborate with other team members on finding unified solutions.
If the whole Scrum team is involved in the process of product backlog grooming, it
becomes much easier to plan and execute a successful and fruitful sprint.
Scrum Sprint
A Scrum sprint is an iteration of development work that is accomplished in a fixed
timeframe. A sprint usually lasts between one and four weeks, but it shouldn't be
longer than a month. The length of a sprint is determined at the beginning of the
agile project and it should be followed throughout the project.
During a sprint, the Scrum team builds a set of features and functionalities
predefined in the sprint goal. At the end of each sprint, a potential new release of
the software is completed.
60
Each agile sprint starts with a sprint planning meeting where the product owner (or
manager), Scrum Master, and development team come together to choose which
backlog features will be completed in the following sprint.
While the product manager decides on the sprint goal and the criteria that need to
be met to achieve the goal, the development team decides how much work can
realistically be done during the sprint.
Once the Scrum sprint begins, the product owner needs to leave the Scrum team to
work independently until the end of the sprint and should only provide feedback and
answer questions if needed.

Sprint planning
The sprint ends when the time allocated for the sprint ends, regardless of whether all
tasks have been completed. After that, a sprint review meeting takes place where
the product owner determines whether the sprint goal has been achieved.
61
The following agile sprint starts as soon as the previous sprint ends, allowing the
development process to work like a well-oiled machine.
What Happens During Sprint Planning?
Sprint planning happens during the sprint planning meeting held by the whole Scrum
team - the product owner, Scrum Master, and the development team.
As its name suggests, sprint planning is the process of planning the following sprint.
The meeting shouldn't take more than eight hours for a month-long sprint, but
ideally, it should take an hour per each week of the sprint.
The plan should be the result of a collaborative discussion of the entire Scrum team
and it should identify the backlog items that will be delivered in the upcoming sprint
and determine how this work will be done.
Sprint planning needs to happen right before the sprint but after the sprint review
and retrospective.
Each successful sprint needs to have a sprint goal, which is the main priority at the
beginning of every sprint planning meeting. The sprint goal is the objective of the
sprint that should guide the development team while building the next product
increment. All tasks for the following sprint should be aligned with the sprint goal.
Who Makes the Decisions?
As we already said, the whole Scrum team should be involved in sprint planning, and
everyone has a specific role:
The Product owner should propose the sprint goal and the backlog items to
work on in the upcoming sprint.
Developers should give estimates on how many tasks they can handle in the
upcoming sprint and discuss how they're planning to deliver these tasks and
ultimately achieve the sprint goal.
62
The Scrum Master facilitates communication between team members and
ensures that the discussion is effective. They need to make sure everyone is
on the same page regarding the goal and the backlog items that will be
handled in the sprint.
Together, they should decide which items from the backlog will be completed in the
sprint, as well as define their requirements, potential problems, and the factors that
will determine when a task has been done.
How To Plan a Scrum Sprint in Infinity
The best way to plan the sprint in Infinity is during the sprint planning meeting. As
the team discusses the tasks that will be done in the next sprint, the product owner
should move tasks from the Backlog to the Sprint folder using drag and drop and
hitting the Move button.
Once a task is moved to the Sprint, the product owner needs to add all necessary
details to define the task. This includes the team member responsible for this task,
estimated time to finish the task, flexible due date, priority, etc. You can use the
Product Management template to plan your sprint, and here's how:
Step 1: Move the task from the Backlog to the Current Sprint folder.
Step 2: A task that was in the Backlog will already have some information filled
out - name, description, assignee, and type. You can update these if
necessary.
Step 3: Add a time estimate that you will get from the developer responsible
for the task.
Step 4: Add the To Do status which will move the task to the first column.
Step 5: Add a priority level - High, Medium, or Low.
Step 6: Add the due date.
Step 7: Link the task to the corresponding feature in the roadmap by adding
the feature reference.
Step 8: Add any relevant links if necessary.
63
After you finish sprint planning, it's time for the sprint. How do you manage a sprint
in Infinity?
One of the most convenient ways to manage sprints is to keep them in separate
folders. After each sprint planning meeting, you can easily move the backlog items
you and the team agree on to the Sprint folder.
Once you have a dedicated Sprint folder, you can recycle it and reuse it throughout
the project. You can simply add new tasks from the backlog after each sprint
planning meeting, and move completed tasks to the Archive folder at the end of the
sprint.
In our Product Management template, you'll notice that the sprint is organized in
columns determining the stages of the task development process. A classic Kanban
approach works well here because it gives the whole Scrum team a clear overview of
the sprint's progress.

As a task progresses through the sprint, you should also move it along the Kanban
board. Each task will start in the To Do column and end up in the Done column once
(and if) the task is completed. People responsible for tasks should move the tasks
they're working on between columns so that the Scrum Master and the rest of the
team always know how the sprint is going.
64
Once a task is completed, it should be moved from the Done column to the Archive
folder.
How to Use Tabs to Organize a Sprint in Infinity
The first and most important tab for the whole Scrum team should be the columns
grouped by status so that everyone on the team can easily track sprint progress.
This way, you'll be able to streamline the sprint process and always the status of
each task and the amount of work left before the end of the sprint. You can easily
add additional tasks if any unexpected work comes up.
The second tab in our template is another Kanban board where tasks are grouped by
type. The third tab is reserved for a calendar, which is going to come in handy when
keeping track of the deadlines. The fourth tab is reserved for daily tasks, while the
fifth one shows the tasks organized by priority.
C

Of course, you can always rearrange your tabs, delete those you don't need, and add
new ones simply by clicking the + button at the end of the tabs bar.
Our Product Management template is available for preview or download, so you
don't have to organize a sprint from scratch.
Why You Need Daily Scrum Meetings
Daily standups, also known as Daily Scrum, are quick daily Scrum meetings that the
Scrum team has every day of the sprint. These meetings should be time-boxed to 15
minutes to keep the discussion quick but effective. To eliminate confusion and keep
things as productive as possible, daily Scrum meetings should be held at the same
time and same place every day. It's best to have them in the morning before the
Scrum team starts their work.
65
The whole team should attend daily standups - the Scrum Master, product
owner/manager, and developers. Other team members can attend and listen but
they shouldn't actively participate in the discussion.
If other people are present at the daily standup, the Scrum Master should ensure
they don't disrupt the meeting.
During the meeting, the Scrum team should go over the Scrum meeting agenda. This
includes synchronizing activities and planning the work for the following 24 hours.
Each team member should state:
What they did the previous day
What they're planning to do that day
Whether there are any obstacles in their way
The Scrum Master needs to make sure to remove those obstacles or find someone
on the team who can do it.

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. What's in my way?
66
By sharing this information, the whole team knows what has been done and what
still needs to be worked on. It's wrong to consider daily standups as feedback
sessions where developers report to the Scrum Master and product owner. Instead,
these meetings should help the whole team gain more knowledge of their progress
and focus on the goal ahead.
Having daily Scrum meetings increases the chances that the development team will
meet the sprint goal.
Sprint Review vs. Sprint Retrospective
Although sprint review and sprint retrospective can be mistaken for the same thing,
these two Scrum events are completely different. Here's a bit more about each of
the two types of meeting and the things that set them apart.
Sprint Review
In each sprint, the Scrum team should produce a potentially shippable product
increment. The sprint review is a meeting at the end of the sprint where the Scrum
team and all stakeholders get together and discuss what has been accomplished
during the sprint and whether the sprint goal has been met.
The people attending the sprint review should include the product owner and
product manager, Scrum Master, the development team, management, and anyone
else involved in the product creation process.
This is usually an informal type of meeting where the Scrum team presents the
product increment, while the stakeholders provide feedback. A sprint review
shouldn't last more than four hours per month-long sprint (up to one hour per each
week of the sprint). The Scrum Master needs to ensure the meeting doesn't run
longer than that.

Product owner + Scrum Master + Team + Others
Aside from presenting the work done during the sprint, sprint review meetings
should have a few other things on the agenda:
The product owner needs to inform the team about the tasks that have been
completed and those that are not yet done.
The developers need to discuss problems they encountered during the sprint
and how they were solved.
The Scrum team answers sprint-related questions from the rest of the team.
The team should discuss which tasks come next, which provides a great basis
for the next sprint planning meeting.
Sprint Retrospective
The sprint retrospective meeting takes place immediately after the sprint review.
While the sprint review is a discussion about what the team is building, the sprint
retrospective is focused on how they're building it.
68
This meeting is usually slightly shorter than the sprint review and shouldn't last more
than three hours per month-long sprint. To get the most out of a sprint retrospective
meeting, you should ensure that the whole Scrum team, including the product
owner, attends and participates.
The goal of a sprint retrospective is to improve the development process. The Scrum
team reflects on the previous sprint and discusses what's working well, what could
be improved, and how they could improve overall productivity.
Although these improvements may be implemented during the sprint, the sprint
retrospective gives the Scrum team a formal opportunity to discuss the process and
motivates each team member to voice their opinion and ideas.

For a successful sprint retrospective meeting, each team member should try to

Instead of using the sprint retrospective as an opportunity for complaints, this
meeting should be constructive with everyone on the team making an effort to
improve the process and create an enjoyable work experience for the whole team.
When organizing sprint review and sprint retrospective meetings, it helps to have a
dedicated task management tool. Infinity offers the Agile Development template you
can customize not only to plan sprints but also to keep and organize sprint review
and sprint retrospective notes, stakeholder feedback, suggestions on how to boost
productivity, and much more.
