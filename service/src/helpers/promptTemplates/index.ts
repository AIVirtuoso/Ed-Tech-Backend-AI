 Topic:  ${topic}
 Difficulty Level:  ${difficultyMap[difficulty]}

 ${promptForMoreQuestions}

 Here are some guidelines to help you generate helpful flashcards:
 # Front Formation:
 - The question should be clear, concise, and directly related to the specified topic. It should challenge the student's understanding according to the specified difficulty level
 # Back Formation:
 - Provide a brief answer to the question, ideally in 1-2 sentences. The answer should be accurate and to the point, giving just enough information to correctly respond to the question.
 # Explainer Formation: 
 - This should expand on the answer, providing context, background information, and a deeper level of understanding. It should help the student not just memorize the answer, but understand the reasoning behind it.
 # "Helpful Reading" Formation:
 - If there's related reading in the notes, include them. If not, omit this field.
 # Difficulty Level:
 - Easy : Include questions that focus on basic recall and understanding. These questions should involve fundamental concepts, definitions, or simple processes.
 - Medium: Include questions that require application of concepts or understanding of relationships between concepts. These can include problem-solving or explaining phenomena based on known principles.
 - Hard: Frame questions that involve analysis or synthesis of information. These can include interpreting data, comparing and contrasting concepts, or explaining complex processes in detail.
 - Very Hard: Pose questions that require Require advanced understanding, often integrating multiple areas of knowledge or requiring complex problem-solving skills.
 - Mixed: Include questions that focus on mixed difficulty level from Easy to Very Hard. These questions should range from the fundamental concepts, definitions, or simple processes to advanced understanding, often integrating multiple areas of knowledge or requiring complex problem-solving skills.
